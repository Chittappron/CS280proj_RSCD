# CS280 Project: Remote Sensing Image Change Detection

This is the repository for CS280 project, where we do Remote Sensing Image Change Detection based on ChangeFormer (https://github.com/wgcban/ChangeFormer). The 'ChangeFormerV6.py' file contains exactly the original model of ChangeFormerV6.

The 'SNUNet-CD.py' contains the original model of SNUNet-CD, of which ECAM is used to refine the Decoder of ChangeFormer.
